Issues that need troubleshooting in the Subscription Tracker codebase:

1. PremiumScreen.tsx (src/screens/PremiumScreen.tsx):
   - The file is completely empty. Needs full implementation for the premium upgrade screen.

2. HomeScreen.tsx (src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx):
   - Unused renderItem function defined but not used in the component.
   - Duplicate subscription rendering logic - subscriptions are mapped directly in JSX instead of using the defined renderItem.
   - formatDate function is defined but never called in the component.

3. SettingsScreen.tsx (src/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx):
   - Settings state is initialized but not loaded from AsyncStorage on component mount.
   - Settings changes are not saved to AsyncStorage - they reset on app restart.
   - No persistence for user preferences (currency, notifications, theme, sound).
   - Unused imports: useEffect, StyleSheet.
   - Implicit 'any' types in setSettings callbacks.

4. DashboardScreen.tsx (src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx):
   - Imports BarChart from react-native-chart-kit but uses LineChart instead (unused import).
   - Imports AsyncStorage but never uses it.
   - Defines TimeRange type but never uses it.
   - Defines chartData variable but never uses it.
   - Chart data uses hardcoded mock historical data instead of real subscription history.
   - mockSubscriptions array is defined but only used as error fallback.
   - Unused imports: useEffect, StyleSheet, BarChart, AsyncStorage.
   - Implicit 'any' types in reduce and map callbacks.

5. SubscriptionForm.tsx (src/components/SubscriptionForm.tsx):
   - Imports 'moment' library but it's not installed (confirmed by TypeScript errors).
   - Date parsing and renewal date calculation will fail without moment.
   - Start date input is a plain TextInput without date picker, prone to invalid date formats.
   - Renewal date calculation may not handle edge cases properly (e.g., leap years, month boundaries).
   - Unused imports: useEffect, StyleSheet.

6. Navigation/index.tsx (src/navigation/index.tsx):
   - RootStackParamList includes 'Timeline' screen but no corresponding screen component exists.
   - Syntax error: '}' expected at line 146 (possible missing closing brace).

7. AddSubscriptionScreen.tsx (src/screens/AddSubscriptionScreen.tsx):
   - Unused import: NativeStackScreenProps.

8. EditSubscriptionScreen.tsx (src/screens/EditSubscriptionScreen.tsx):
   - Unused import: NativeStackScreenProps.

9. SubscriptionService.ts (src/services/SubscriptionService.ts):
   - ID generation uses Date.now().toString() which could potentially create duplicate IDs if multiple subscriptions are added in rapid succession.

10. General issues:
    - Many TypeScript errors due to missing dependencies (React, React Native, etc.) but these are environment-related.
    - No error boundaries or global error handling.
    - No loading states for async operations in some components.
    - Hardcoded colors and styles could be centralized in a theme file.
    - No unit tests for any components or services.
    - Implicit 'any' types in several places need proper typing.
